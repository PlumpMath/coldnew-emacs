Before we start this section, we need to initialize =package.el= first.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; This must come before configurations of installed packages.
  ;; Don't delete this line. If you don't want it, just comment it out by adding a
  ;; semicolon to the start of the line. You may delete these explanatory
  ;; comments.
  (package-initialize)

* Install libraries

To install these libraries, you only need to use =M-x package-install= command.
