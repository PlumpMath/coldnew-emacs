#+DESCRIPTION: Some my personal's interactive commands

#+SETUPFILE: configs.setup

In emacs, we can use =M-x= to execute interactive commands, I implement some of them to make my emacs more easy to use.
* Use lexical binding

For some of my functions, and general coolness, =lexical binding= is a must.
Without it, closures cannot be made for example.

This line needs to appear at the beginning of the file to work. Just to keep
things looking nice I put it at the beginning of the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :padline no
  ;; -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
#+END_SRC

* Buffers                                                            :buffer:

** Kill all buffers except *scratch* buffer

Sometimes I just want to kill all buffers, this command will kill all
of them and make =*scratch*= buffer alone.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun nuke-all-buffers ()
    "Kill all buffers, leaving *scratch* only."
    (interactive)
    (mapcar (lambda (x) (kill-buffer x)) (buffer-list))
    (delete-other-windows))
#+END_SRC

** Make emacs can always save buffers (even if file is not modified)

The default command *save-buffer* will not really save file when it
untouched, use this command can let me force save file even if file is
not modified.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/save-buffer-always ()
    "Save the buffer even if it is not modified."
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-modified-p t)
    (save-buffer))
#+END_SRC

** Abort minibuffer recursive edit

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun minibuffer-keyboard-quit ()
    "Abort recursive edit.
  In Delete Selection mode, if the mark is active, just deactivate it;
  then it takes a second \\[keyboard-quit] to abort the minibuffer."
    (interactive)
    (if (and delete-selection-mode transient-mark-mode mark-active)
        (setq deactivate-mark t)
      (when (get-buffer "*Completions*") (delete-windows-on "*Completions*"))
      (abort-recursive-edit)))
#+END_SRC

** Make buffer untabify

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun indent-whole-buffer ()
    "Indent whole buffer."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (indent-region (point-min) (point-max))))
#+END_SRC

** Remove buffers trailing whitespace and untabify

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun cleanup-buffer ()
    "Perform a bunch of operations on the whitespace content of a buffer."

      (indent-region (point-min) (point-max))
      (untabify (point-min) (point-max))))
#+END_SRC

** Replace the preceding sexp with its value

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun eval-and-replace ()
    "Replace the preceding sexp with its value."
    (interactive)
    (backward-kill-sexp)
    (condition-case nil
        (prin1 (eval (read (current-kill 0)))
               (current-buffer))
      (error (message "Invalid expression")
             (insert (current-kill 0)))))

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
