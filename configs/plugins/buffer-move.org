#+DESCRIPTION: buffer-move.el setup

#+SETUPFILE: configs.setup

This file is for lazy people wanting to swap buffers without typing C-x b on each window. This is useful when you have :

+--------------+-------------+
|              |             |
|    #emacs    |    #gnus    |
|              |             |
+--------------+-------------+
|                            |
|           .emacs           |
|                            |
+----------------------------+

and you want to have :

+--------------+-------------+
|              |             |
|    #gnus     |   .emacs    |
|              |             |
+--------------+-------------+
|                            |
|           #emacs           |
|                            |
+----------------------------+

With buffer-move, just go in #gnus, do =buf-move-left=, go to #emacs (which now should be on top right) and do =buf-move-down=.
