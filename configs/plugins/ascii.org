#+SETUPFILE: configs.setup

[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AsciiMode][ascii.el]] provides a way to display ASCII code on a window, that is, display in another window an ASCII table highlighting the current character code.

* Install libraries

To install these libraries, you only need to use =M-x package-install= command.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-install 'ascii)
#+END_SRC

* Install System packages

It's no need to install any futher packages for this setup.

* Plugins Setup

Some setup for [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AsciiMode][ascii.el]] , since it doesn't has toggle command, I add one called =ascii-toggle= to toggle the =ascii-mode= ã€‚

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ascii
    :config

    ;; A simple toggle command
    (defun ascii-toggle ()
      "Toggle ascii-mode."
      (interactive)
      (if (not (ascii-off)) (ascii-on)))

    ;; alias ascii to ascii-toggle
    (defalias 'ascii 'ascii-toggle))
#+END_SRC
